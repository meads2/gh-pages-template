        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Hello guys! Thanks for checking this project out. To start things
          off I would like to give a huge shoutout to the original creator
          of the idea for this minimal theme
          <a href="https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal">Mr. Steve Smith A.K.A orderedlist</a>
          I took his theme and kind of tweaked the design a bit and alos ported
          the whole project over to a SCSS strucutre, so you can go wild with customizing stuff.
          I also added a little personal touch, with a completely customizeable terminal
          so you can show people just how easy your project is to use!
        </p>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
          Getting started is very easy. Like many other projects we
          have several options. You can use Bower, NPM, CDN, .ZIP
          we gottem all. So grab the link from below and start
          coding to your heart's desires.
        </p>
        <!-- Code block -->
        <pre><code class="language-bash">npm install page.js -- save</code></pre>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">bower install page.js -- save</code></pre>
        <pre><code class="language-bash">gem install page.js -- save</code></pre>
        <!-- Tooltip Box -->
        <div class="toolbox info">
          <div class="tb-header">
            <i class="ion-android-alert"></i>
            <h4>Extra Careful</h4>
          </div>
          <div class="tb-body">
            <p>
              If you are having trouble running the above
              commands, then make sure you have the right
              permissions.

        <h2>Node JS</h2>
        <p>
          Node JS is such a popular language these days and
          it only makes sense that this library would fit
          well with a real time engine like Node. Make sure
          to require it with the rest of your node modules.
        </p>
        <h2>Advanced Routing</h2>

          This is sample paragraph text that will show off how awesome

            with a totally dope terminal, where you customize the code inside
            it even supports some basic syntax highlighting.
